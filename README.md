### DATE: 22-8-26
### AIM: To implement Link Analysis using HITS Algorithm in Python.
### Description:
<div align = "justify">
The HITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search) algorithm is a link analysis algorithm used to rank web pages. It identifies authority and hub pages 
in a network of web pages based on the structure of the links between them.

### Procedure:
1. ***Initialization:***
    <p>    a) Start with an initial set of authority and hub scores for each page.
    <p>    b) Typically, initial scores are set to 1 or some random values.
  
2. ***Construction of the Adjacency Matrix:***
    <p>    a) The web graph is represented as an adjacency matrix where each row and column correspond to a web page, and the matrix elements denote the presence or absence of links between pages.
    <p>    b) If page A has a link to page B, the corresponding element in the adjacency matrix is set to 1; otherwise, it's set to 0.

3. ***Iterative Updates:***
    <p>    a) Update the authority scores based on the hub scores of pages pointing to them and update the hub scores based on the authority scores of pages they point to.
    <p>    b) Calculate authority scores as the sum of hub scores of pages pointing to the given page.
    <p>    c) Calculate hub scores as the sum of authority scores of pages that the given page points to.

4. ***Normalization:***
    <p>    a) Normalize authority and hub scores to prevent them from becoming too large or small.
    <p>    b) Normalize by dividing by their Euclidean norms (L2-norm).

5. ***Convergence Check:***
    <p>    a) Check for convergence by measuring the change in authority and hub scores between iterations.
    <p>    b) If the change falls below a predefined threshold or the maximum number of iterations is reached, the algorithm stops.

6. ***Visualization:***
    <p>    Visualize using bar chart to represent authority and hub scores.
